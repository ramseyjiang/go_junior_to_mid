A running program will store objects in two memory locations, the heap and the stack.

Garbage collection operates on the heap, not the stack. 
The stack is a LIFO data structure that stores function values.

Go programs prefer to allocate memory on the stack, so most memory allocations will end up there.
This means that Go has a stack per goroutine and when possible Go will allocate variables to this stack.

Stack frames are individual memory spaces for each function call, this means that 
# **Go has a stack per function, and when possible, Go will allocate variables to this stack.**

The Go compiler attempts to prove that a variable is not needed outside the function by performing escape analysis to see
if an object “escapes” the function.
# **Escape analysis, it chases across functions and packages to check if the memory should be allocated to a heap or stack.**

Values, in the stack, are returned inside a function.
For an instance, when a program is running, calling another function from within a function pushes a new frame onto the stack, 
which will contain the values of that function and so on. 
When the called function returns, its stack frame is popped off the stack.

In contrast, the heap contains values that are referenced outside a function.
For example, statically defined constants at the start of a program, or more complex objects, like Go structs. 
The heap is a graph where objects are represented as nodes that are referred to in code or by other objects in the heap. 
As a program runs, the heap will continue to grow as objects are added unless the heap is cleaned up.

# **Generally if a Go program has a pointer to an object then that object is stored on the heap.**


# **Go compiler tries to determine a variable’s lifetime and size. If it succeeds, then it will be allocated to a stack frame.**
If the compiler can determine a variable lifetime, it will be allocated to a stack. 
However, if the variable’s lifetime is unclear it will be allocated to the heap.


Go GC means Go Garbage collectors. GC has two key parts, a mutator, and a collector.
The collector executes garbage collection logic and finds objects that should have their memory freed.
The collector is the section or functionality where collecting and detecting of the garbage take place according to algorithm.

The mutator executes application code and allocates new objects to the heap. 
It also updates existing objects on the heap as the program runs, 
which includes making some objects unreachable when they’re no longer needed.
The mutator is the initial phase before any garbage collecting where the heap allocation happens.

# Generally, the mutator is utilised to assign objects to the heap and clear unused objects in the heap.

Go’s garbage collector is a non-generational, concurrent, tri-color mark and sweep garbage collector.

1.Non-generational
A generational garbage collector focuses on recently allocated objects.
Compiler optimisations allow the Go compiler to allocate objects with a known lifetime to the stack.
This means fewer objects will be on the heap, so fewer objects will be garbage collected.
# **It means a generational garbage collector is not necessary in Go. So, Go uses a non-generational garbage collector.**

2.Concurrent:the collector runs at the same time as mutator threads.

That's why Go uses a non-generational concurrent garbage collector.

3.Mark and sweep is the type of garbage collector
The algorithm has two phases, marking and sweeping.
In the mark phase, the collector traverses the heap and marks live objects.
In the sweep phase, these unmarked objects will be removed.
Mark and sweep is an indirect algorithm, as it marks live objects, and removes everything else.

Implementation mark and sweep steps:
Go has all goroutines reach a garbage collection safe point with a process called **stop the world.**
This temporarily stops the program from running and turns write barriers on to maintain data integrity on the heap.
This allows for concurrency by allowing goroutines and the collector to run simultaneously.

Once all goroutines has writing barriers on, the Go runtime **starts the world** and has workers perform the garbage collection work.

**tri-color algorithm**
The algorithm divides objects in the heap into three sets according to the color assigned, black, white, and grey.

The algorithm divides objects in the heap into three sets according to the colour assigned, black, white, and grey. 
White objects are garbage. Grey ones need to be checked and figure out if they are still in use and have reference to the white ones. 
If they don't have, they will turn white. 
If not, then they will be changed to the black set which is guaranteed to not have any reference to the white set, and they will stay safe.

When marking begins, all objects are white except for the root objects which are grey. 
Roots are objects that all other heap objects come from, and are instantiated as part of running the program. 
The garbage collector begins marking by scanning stacks, globals and heap pointers to understand what is in use. 
When scanning a stack, the worker stops the goroutine and marks all found objects grey by traversing downwards from the roots objects. 
It resumes the goroutine after the scan finishes.
Once that happened, the goroutine will be resumed the goroutine after the scan finishes. 
And then, the grey objects are enqueued to be turned black, which indicates that they're still in use. 
The queue is only used at this point. 
Once all grey objects have been turned black, the collector will stop the world again and clean up all the white nodes that are no longer needed. 
The program can now continue running until it needs to clean up more memory again.
