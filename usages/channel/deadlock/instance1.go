when we write or read data from a channel, that goroutine is blocked and control is passed to available goroutines.
What if there are no other goroutines available, imagine all of them are sleeping.
That’s where deadlock error occurs crashing the whole program.

If you are trying to read data from a channel but channel does not have a value available with it,
it will block current goroutine and unblock others until some goroutines push a value into it.
Hence, this sends operation will be blocked.

In the program above, we don’t have any other goroutines sending data to the channel.
Since there is no other channel available, the Golang program will encounter a deadlock waiting to receive the data.
These errors seem like all goroutines are asleep or simply no other goroutines are available to schedule.

Because it only sends data to a goroutine, but it does not have a goroutine to receive it before.
